# SafeHavens
Our platform, CampusHome, connects students in search of accommodations in school areas to landlords and house agents. With AccomoMatch, students can easily find safe and affordable housing near their schools, and landlords and house agents can easily reach out to potential tenants.

CampusHome features a user-friendly search interface that allows students to filter available accommodations by location, price, number of rooms, and other criteria. The platform also provides detailed listings for each accommodation, with photos, descriptions, and contact information for the landlord or house agent.

Landlords and house agents can use AccomoMatch to list their available properties and reach out to potential tenants. The platform provides easy-to-use forms for adding new listings and managing existing ones, as well as tools for tracking and responding to inquiries from students.

CampusHome is secure and reliable, with a user authentication system that ensures only registered users can access the platform. Whether you are a student looking for a place to live, a landlord with available properties, or a house agent with a roster of listings, CampusHome is the perfect platform for finding and offering accommodations in school areas.
