# SafeHavens

Our platform, CampusHome, connects students in search of accommodations in school areas to landlords and house agents. With AccomoMatch, students can easily find safe and affordable housing near their schools, and landlords and house agents can easily reach out to potential tenants.

CampusHome features a user-friendly search interface that allows students to filter available accommodations by location, price, number of rooms, and other criteria. The platform also provides detailed listings for each accommodation, with photos, descriptions, and contact information for the landlord or house agent.
